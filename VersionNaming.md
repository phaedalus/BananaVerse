# Versioning Sequence

The versioning system for this app is moving away from Greek and mythological names toward a **practical, understandable system** that clearly communicates both major updates and incremental improvements.

## 1. Major Version Number (`X.Y`)
- The **major number** (the `X` in `X.Y`) represents a significant release or overhaul of the app.  
- The **minor number** (the `Y` in `X.Y`) represents the next cycle of updates or enhancements after the initial major release.  
- **Example:**  
  - `1.0` → the first full release of the new app  
  - `1.1` → the next major update, adding new features or design improvements  

## 2. Phonetic Alphabet Suffix
- Each major/minor version is accompanied by a **phonetic alphabet name** (`Alpha`, `Bravo`, `Charlie`, etc.) to indicate the **stage or type of update** within that version.  
- **Example:**  
  - `1.0 Alpha` → first release of the 1.0 version  
  - `1.0 Bravo` → second significant update to 1.0  
  - `1.0 Charlie` → smaller enhancements or tweaks to 1.0  

## 3. Optional Patch Number
- Minor fixes or adjustments to a phonetic stage can be indicated with a dash and number:  
  - `1.0 Alpha-1` → first patch for the 1.0 Alpha release  
  - `1.0 Bravo-2` → second patch for the 1.0 Bravo release

## Key Points
- **Major version** signals the overall stage of the app.  
- **Phonetic suffix** communicates the **type or sequence of updates** within that version.  
- This system is **practical and easy to understand**, unlike Greek or mythological names which are abstract and harder to follow.  
- Using phonetic names allows you to **clearly communicate progress** and avoids confusing number jumps.
